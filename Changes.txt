Possible Changes and Improvements:
Feel free to ask for specific changes, but based on the analysis, here are some suggestions:

1. Camera Integration in start_capturing Route:
You mentioned integrating camera functionality. This can be done using JavaScript (client-side) or Flask/Python (server-side). Would you like help with integrating:

Browser-based Camera Access using JavaScript (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia)?
Server-based Image Capture using a library like OpenCV if the camera is server-side?
2. Add Pagination and Filtering in show_results:
Pagination: If there are many results, load them in smaller chunks.
python
Copy code
# Example pagination
results = Result.query.paginate(page=page, per_page=10)
Filtering: Allow users to filter results by date range, location, or underage status.
Implement simple dropdowns or date pickers for this on the results page.
3. Input Validation for Forms:
Add client-side validation for fields like email, phone number, and password strength.
Use JavaScript to validate the forms before submission, such as:
html
Copy code
<input type="email" id="email" required pattern="[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$">
For the password, implement checks for minimum length, special characters, and numbers.
4. Error Handling and Alerts:
Add try-except blocks for database operations, like user creation, location addition, and result fetching. You can handle errors gracefully and flash error messages to users.
Example:
python
Copy code
try:
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()
except Exception as e:
    db.session.rollback()
    flash('An error occurred: ' + str(e), 'error')
5. Security Enhancements:
Implement CSRF Protection using Flask-WTF to avoid cross-site request forgery attacks in form submissions.
Ensure HTTPS is enabled for data transmission to prevent sensitive information (like passwords) from being intercepted.
6. UI/UX Improvements:
Add loading states or spinners on actions like form submission and starting image capture to provide feedback to the user.
In the results page, allow users to click to enlarge the captured images for better inspection.
Add a confirmation dialog for important actions like adding a location or logging out.
7. Logout and Session Expiry:
Set a session expiry time to ensure users are logged out after a certain period of inactivity for security purposes:
python
Copy code
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(minutes=30)
8. Improved Dashboard Functionality:
Enhance the dashboard to provide summaries or statistics. For example:
The number of captured images.
A summary of locations added.
Recent detection logs.
